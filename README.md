# React Tutorial by DevEd

Attempting to learn fundamentals of React.

# Learned

- Creating a react app using `create-react-app` utility
- Running the react development server
- Creating, referencing and exporting React Components
- Writing basic JSX
    - Embedding variables and functions using `{}` syntax
    - Understanding syntax (eg `className` vs class)
- Embedding a component into another component
- Usage of Basic Hooks API (`useState()` adn `getState()`)

Overall a great tutorial, easy to follow, concise and well thought out. I learned a lot about how React is structured and behaves, as well as how it compares to other rendering engines like `jinja2`. The next steps will involve taking a deeper dive into React Hooks, deployment and integrating RESTful API into a React application.

# Creating the React App

```sh
npx create-react-app react-tutorial-deved
```

# Folder structure

**Important**

`node_modules` - Contains npm modules (gitignore ignores these)
`public` - Contains index and favicon
`src` - Contains React components

**Dont worry about these for now**

`package-lock.json` - Contains specific versioning for packages
`package.json` - Contains scripts (run, build, start etc)
`README.md and .gitignore` - Version control

# Tests

- Creating a new React component
- Referencing and rendering a new React component
- Creating a template consisting of multiple React components
- Using map to loop through arrays and rendering them
- Storing state and updating the state
