# React Tutorial by DevEd

Attempting to learn fundamentals of React.

# Learned

- Creating a react app using `create-react-app` utility
- Running the react development server
- Creating, referencing and exporting React Components
- Writing basic JSX
    - Embedding variables and functions using `{}` syntax
    - Understanding syntax (eg `className` vs class)
- Embedding a component into another component

# Process

### Creating the React App

```sh
npx create-react-app react-tutorial-deved
```

### Folder structure

**Important**

`node_modules` - Contains npm modules (gitignore ignores these)
`public` - Contains index and favicon
`src` - Contains React components

**Dont worry about these for now**

`package-lock.json` - Contains specific versioning for packages
`package.json` - Contains scripts (run, build, start etc)
`README.md and .gitignore` - Version control

# Tests
